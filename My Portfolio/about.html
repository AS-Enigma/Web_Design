      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi, My name is Alex. I'm a Junior and I learned how to use Adobe Programs in the past two years from the Graphic Design classes at Crooms, and I plan to continue to learn how to use them to go into Graphic Design in the future. I consider myself to be an artistic person, for as long as I can rememeber I'be always been drawing at one point or another. I've always liked creating designs and illustrating different things like landscapes, characters, and objects which is what then got me into Digital Design, because I could do what I love as a job. When I'm not drawing or designing things, I'm still creative. I write original fiction and have been for the past three years, and I also occasionally paint. I also listen to music and play video games (mostly Stardew Valley, Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Reverse1999, and Genshin Impact.)</p>
      <h1>Favorite Songs</h1>
      <p>Here are some of my favorite songs to listen to because I always listen to something when I draw or write. I could probably listen to these songs on repeat and not get bored of them.</p>
